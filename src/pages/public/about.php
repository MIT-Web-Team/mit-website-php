            With the dawn of Independence, the need for establishing a sound
            technological basis for proper industrial advancement of the country
            was realised. Towards the fulfilment of this need, a number of
            Engineering Institutions were established by several State
            Governments. It was at this juncture that Mr.C.Rajam, with his
            characteristic pioneering spirit, patriotic fervor and unwavering
            enthusiasm came up with a munificent donation of Rs. 5 lakhs through
            the sale of his house and founded the MIT, with the blessings of the
            Sage of Kanchi, the Jagadguru Sankaracharya Swamigal. In this noble
            effort, Mr.Rajam enjoyed the inspired assistance of a few
            distinguished citizens, notably Subbaraya Aiyar, M.K. Ranganathan,
            L.Venkatakrishna Iyer, K.Srinivasan and C.R. Srinivasan and also
            generous donations from the public and industries. Thus in July 1949,
            the MIT was established as an All India Technological Institution with
            the two-fold objectives of providing

            At a time when all other Engineering Institutions were offering
            conventional courses in Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering
            at the Under-graduate level, it was the rare innovation and foresight
            of Mr. Rajam that impelled him in the eve of his life to launch on a
            bold experiment of introducing for the first time in our country,
            totally new areas of specialisation in Engineering, viz. Aeronautical
            Engineering, Automobile Engineering, Electronics Engineering and
            Instrumentation Technology, the entrants to these disciplines being
            Science graduates. This was a pioneering step in engineering education
            in India. How wise and foreseeing this selection was, is shown by the
            striking growth that India has made in road transport and in the
            manufacture of road vehicles of all types; in the progress of civil
            and military aviation and the manufacture of military aircraft; and in
            the enormous growth in the applications of electronics and the
            electronics manufacturing industry. Instrumentation and Control which
            form the bedrock of industry did not exist in India as a subject of
            study in 1949; even the name was still below the horizon. Now this
            branch of applied science and technology has become all important in
            every industry, small or big, light or heavy. How useful and relevant
            the trained manpower in these fields has been, is borne out by the
            fact that a significantly large number of the past students of MIT are
            now holding key positions in research and development organisations,
            manufacturing industries and educational institutions within the
            country and abroad. The broad-based curriculum at the MIT has indeed
            proved to be particularly advantageous with the ever-increasing need
            for engineers adequately equipped to handle a wide range of problems.
